  - URL analysis: List all classified URL with clickable texts in a buffer, or jump around with
   [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The project target is to apply org features and analysis capability to =shr=, and
all libraries that render HTML with =shr= (Simple HTML Renderer).

As [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HtmlRendering][EmacsWiki]] says:

=shr.el= is an HTML renderer in Emacs as of version 24.4 (based on libxml2, it was
originally a part of Gnus). Itâ€™s the basis of the web browser =eww=.
#+END_QUOTE


* Installation

It's available on [[https://melpa.org/][Melpa]] :

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x package-install shrface
#+END_SRC

* Configuration

** Quick Start

From version =1.9=, users have to enable the =shrface= by themselves, by calling
=(shrface-basic)= or =(shrface-trail)= after =(require 'shrface)=. Be sure to wrap all
the following settings mentioned in this document into =(with-eval-after-load
'shr)=, it can save you a lot of boot up time.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'shr ; lazy load is very important, it can save you a lot of boot up time
  (require 'shrface)
  (shrface-basic) ; enable shrfaces, must be called before loading eww/dash-docs/nov.el
  (shrface-trial) ; enable shrface experimental face(s), must be called before loading eww/dash-docs/nov.el
  (setq shrface-href-versatile t) ; enable versatile URL faces support
                                  ; (http/https/ftp/file/mailto/other), if
                                  ; `shrface-href-versatile' is nil, default
                                  ; face `shrface-href-face' would be used.
  (setq shrface-toggle-bullets nil) ; Set t if you do not like headline bullets

  ;; eww support
  (with-eval-after-load 'eww
    (add-hook 'eww-after-render-hook 'shrface-mode))

  ;; nov support
  (with-eval-after-load 'nov
    (setq nov-shr-rendering-functions '((img . nov-render-img) (title . nov-render-title))) ; reset nov-shr-rendering-functions, in case of the list get bigger and bigger
    (setq nov-shr-rendering-functions (append nov-shr-rendering-functions shr-external-rendering-functions))
    (add-hook 'nov-mode-hook 'shrface-mode))

  ;; mu4e support
  (with-eval-after-load 'mu4e
    (add-hook 'mu4e-view-mode-hook 'shrface-mode)))

#+END_SRC

- Check this section to see the supported faces:
    #+html: <a href="#supported-faces">Supported Faces</a>

- Check the experimental faces notes here:
    #+html: <a href="#experimental-faces">Experimental faces</a>

- There is another library =inherit-org= to inherit org faces to even more non-org
  buffers, and it is no dependency/relationships with =shrface=, check here
    https://github.com/chenyanming/inherit-org

*** Notes about setting for =nov.el=
Since =nov-shr-rendering-functions= is not a customizable variable. Therefore,
following setting is not included into the package at this moment.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq nov-shr-rendering-functions '((img . nov-render-img) (title . nov-render-title))) ; reset nov-shr-rendering-functions, in case of the list get bigger and bigger
(setq nov-shr-rendering-functions (append nov-shr-rendering-functions shr-external-rendering-functions))
#+END_SRC

** Keybinding Settings
You can set the keybinding directly with the original org outline related
functions, like =org-cycle=, =org-shifttab=, =org-content=, =org-overview=, etc, and
most of =outline= minior mode functions (prefix with =outline-=) after testing.

Here is the keybinding example:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'nov
  (define-key nov-mode-map (kbd "<tab>") 'org-cycle)
  (define-key nov-mode-map (kbd "S-<tab>") 'org-shifttab)
  (define-key nov-mode-map (kbd "C-t") 'shrface-toggle-bullets)
  (define-key nov-mode-map (kbd "C-j") 'shrface-next-headline)
  (define-key nov-mode-map (kbd "C-k") 'shrface-previous-headline)
  (define-key nov-mode-map (kbd "C-i") 'shrface-links-counsel) ; or 'shrface-links-helm
  (define-key nov-mode-map (kbd "C-o") 'shrface-headline-counsel)) ; or 'shrface-headline-helm

(with-eval-after-load 'eww
  (define-key eww-mode-map (kbd "<tab>") 'org-cycle)
  (define-key eww-mode-map (kbd "S-<tab>") 'org-shifttab)
  (define-key eww-mode-map (kbd "C-t") 'shrface-toggle-bullets)
  (define-key eww-mode-map (kbd "C-j") 'shrface-next-headline)
  (define-key eww-mode-map (kbd "C-k") 'shrface-previous-headline)
  (define-key eww-mode-map (kbd "C-i") 'shrface-links-counsel) ; or 'shrface-links-helm
  (define-key eww-mode-map (kbd "C-o") 'shrface-headline-counsel)) ; or 'shrface-headline-helm

(with-eval-after-load 'mu4e
  (define-key mu4e-view-mode-map (kbd "<tab>") 'org-cycle)
  (define-key mu4e-view-mode-map (kbd "S-<tab>") 'org-shifttab)
  (define-key mu4e-view-mode-map (kbd "C-t") 'shrface-toggle-bullets)
  (define-key mu4e-view-mode-map (kbd "C-j") 'shrface-next-headline)
  (define-key mu4e-view-mode-map (kbd "C-k") 'shrface-previous-headline)
  (define-key mu4e-view-mode-map (kbd "C-i") 'shrface-links-counsel) ; or 'shrface-links-helm
  (define-key mu4e-view-mode-map (kbd "C-o") 'shrface-headline-counsel)) ; or 'shrface-headline-helm
#+END_SRC

PS: =org-show-children= are not 100% supported, since the =regexp-fmt= is
 hard coded and override it is inappropriate (It is better to update =org.el=
 directly). Besides, you can use [[https://github.com/tj64/outline-magic][outline-magic]] as alternative.

** Features Anatomy
*** shrface-basic, shrface-trail, shrface-resume
By calling =shrface-baisic= and =shrface-trail=, it will do some configurations to enable *shrface*.

By calling =shrface-resume=, you can disable *shrface* and resume to original setting.

To resume nov original setting, you should also run this:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq nov-shr-rendering-functions '((img . nov-render-img) (title . nov-render-title)))
#+END_SRC

Please notice: The above features may be handled by =shrface-mode= directly in
future versions.

*** shrface-mode
From version =1.8=, =shrface-mode= is adapted, for it is more flexible to
enable/disable the following additional features:
1. =imenu=
2. =outline-minior-mode=
3. =org-indent-mode=

For example, to enable =shrface-mode= to =eww=, =nov= or =mu4e=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'eww
    (add-hook 'eww-after-render-hook 'shrface-mode)) ; this will affect eww and dash-docs
  (with-eval-after-load 'nov
    (setq nov-shr-rendering-functions '((img . nov-render-img) (title . nov-render-title))) ; reset nov-shr-rendering-functions, in case of the list get bigger and bigger
    (setq nov-shr-rendering-functions (append nov-shr-rendering-functions shr-external-rendering-functions))
    (add-hook 'nov-mode-hook 'shrface-mode))
  (with-eval-after-load 'mu4e
    (add-hook 'mu4e-view-mode-hook 'shrface-mode))
#+END_SRC

Besides, you can enable/disable =shrface-mode= via =M-x=

*** shrface-analysis
*shrface-analysis* is new concept brought from version *2.2*.
*shrface-analysis* will help you analyze the html buffer, and give you a robust
result that you can interactive with.

**** shrface-occur
List all headlines, and you can easily jump between them by
mouse click.

**** shrface-links
List all URLs and classify them. 
You can easily go to the
occurrence (Left Click/Enter), copy the URL (Middle Click) or browse the URL
(Right Click). Besides, if [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons]] is available, web icon for each link
will be shown.

**** shrface-links-counsel
List all URLs with =counsel=.
- The URLs are listed in order based the position on the buffer.
- The first candidate to select is the *next url* counting from the current cursor
  position. In this case, you can use =C-M-m (ivy-call)=, =C-M-n
  (ivy-next-line-and-call)=, and =C-M-p (ivy-previous-line-and-call)= to jump
  around all URLs without losing your position.
- =C-o= to fire the action menu on the selected candidate.
- =C-c C-o= to fire the =ivy-occur=

**** shrface-headline-counsel
List all headlines with =counsel=.
- It is a better solution than =imenu= and =shrface-occur.=
- It can work without the headline bullets. You can disable the bullets via
  =(setq shrface-toggle-bullets t)= and still be able to jump around the headlines.
- The first candidate to select is the *current context headline* of the current
  cursor position. In this case, you can use =C-M-m (ivy-call)=, =C-M-n
  (ivy-next-line-and-call)=, and =C-M-p (ivy-previous-line-and-call)= to jump
  around all headlines without losing your position.
- =C-o= to fire the action menu on the selected candidate.
- =C-c C-o= to fire the =ivy-occur=

**** shrface-links-helm
List all URLs with =helm=.
- =TAB= to preview the link
- =RET= to goto the link
 
**** shrface-headline-helm
List all headlines with =helm=.
- =TAB= to preview the headline
- =RET= to goto the headlin

**** shrface-next-headline, shrface-previous-headline
These two headline functions are designed to replace =outline-next-headline= and
=outline-previous-headline=. They scan the headline number text properties and
jump to the headlines which means it can work under no bullets circumstance if
=(setq shrface-toggle-bullets t)=.

*** Headline bullets (h1 to h6)
**** Customize the headline bullets
You can configure your farourite bullets up to 6 levels of headings (cycled
through if less than 6 bullets in setting).

You can set it with:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq shrface-bullets-bullet-list ("â—‰" "â—‹" "âœ¸" "âœ¿"))
#+END_SRC

PS: The bullets setting can be derived from =org-bullets-bullet-list= or
=org-superstar-headline-bullets-list=, if [[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets]] or [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][org-superstar]] is
available.

**** Toggle headline bullets locally/temporary

The quick way to toggle(disable/enable) headline bullets locally/temporary:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x shrface-toggle-bullets
#+END_SRC

Please notice: In =mu4e-view-mode=, using =shrface-toggle-bullets= will toggle
bullets globally. It can not be fixed right now.

**** Disable headline bullets globally
If you do not like headline bullets, disable them globally by:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq shrface-toggle-bullets t)
#+END_SRC

Please notice, the following features are also disabled:
1. function =shrface-occur=
2. variable =shrface-mode=

However, the following features are still be able to use:
1. function =shrface-links=
2. function =shrface-links-counsel=
3. function =shrface-headlines-counsel=
4. function =shrface-previous-headline=
5. function =shrface-next-headline=
6. function =shrface-links-helm=
7. function =shrface-headline-helm=

*** Item bullet
You can configure your favorite item bullet for shrface

You can set it with:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq shrface-item-bullet "âž¤")
#+END_SRC

PS: Only one type of item bullet is supported, prettified by
=shrface-item-bullet-face=

*** Paragraph indentation and fill column
You can configure the *paragraph* indentation (obsolete, default is 0, because the
indentation is managed by =org-indent-mode= started from version 1.6, but you can
still use it for more indentation spaces) and fill column for better reading
experience. These two settings is useful when you read =epub= files that have lots
of paragraphs, like novels.

You can set them with:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq shrface-paragraph-indentation 0)
(setq shrface-paragraph-fill-column 120)
#+END_SRC

PS: The default setting is 0 and 120

*** Versatile URL
You can enable versatile URL faces support simply by:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq shrface-href-versatile t)
#+END_SRC

The following types of URL can be customized.

- http
- https
- ftp
- file
- mailto
- other

*** Supported faces

#+END_SRC

**** Enable the =shrface-code=
=shrface-code= is experimental face, and it is not stable to use, but you can
still add the following statement to enable it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(shrface-trial)
#+END_SRC

**** Important notes on experimental faces
Please notice, =shrface-code= is an experimental face, which may make =eww= hangup
at some specific websites (not all). However, it work perfectly with local html files
during testing with =dash-docs= or =nov.el=

For example, browse =eww= with
[[https://github.com/chenyanming/shrface]]

=eww= still keep connecting to the remote which sometimes
will trigger a loop, the only solution so far is after loading the page,
list all connections through

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x list-processes
#+END_SRC

then press "d" to kill the connections before the hangup.

Welcome test and report.

** (Optional) Enable source codes highlight
You can install [[https://github.com/xuchunyang/shr-tag-pre-highlight.el][shr-tag-pre-highlight.el]] to enable source codes highlight and
background color.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package shr-tag-pre-highlight
  :ensure t
  :after shr
  :config
  (add-to-list 'shr-external-rendering-functions
               '(pre . shr-tag-pre-highlight))
  (when (version< emacs-version "26")
    (with-eval-after-load 'eww
      (advice-add 'eww-display-html :around
                  'eww-display-html--override-shr-external-rendering-functions))))
#+END_SRC

*** Hacking the =shr-tag-pre-highlight.el=

If you want to add indentation, background color, =#+BEGIN_SRC lang=, and =#+END_SRC= for, you can overwrite the function as following:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'shr-tag-pre-highlight)
(add-to-list 'shr-external-rendering-functions '(pre . shrface-shr-tag-pre-highlight))
(defun shrface-shr-tag-pre-highlight (pre)
  "Highlighting code in PRE."
  (let* ((shr-folding-mode 'none)

                   (progn
                     (setq-local fill-column shrface-paragraph-fill-column)
                     (indent-rigidly (point-min) (point-max) shrface-paragraph-indentation)))
                 (buffer-string)))
         (lang (or (shr-tag-pre-highlight-guess-language-attr pre)
                   (let ((sym (language-detection-string code)))
                     (and sym (symbol-name sym)))))
         (mode (and lang
                    (shr-tag-pre-highlight--get-lang-mode lang))))
    (shr-ensure-newline)
    (insert (make-string shrface-paragraph-indentation ?\ )) ; make indent string
    ;; (insert (propertize (concat "#+BEGIN_SRC " lang) 'face 'org-block-begin-line))
    (shr-ensure-newline)
    (setq start (point))
    (insert
     (or (and (fboundp mode)
              (with-demoted-errors "Error while fontifying: %S"
                (shrface-tag-pre-highlight-fontify code mode)
                ))
         code))
    (shr-ensure-newline)
    (setq end (point))
    (insert (make-string shrface-paragraph-indentation ?\ )) ; make indent string
    ;; (insert (propertize "#+END_SRC" 'face 'org-block-end-line ) )
    (let* ((beg start)
           (xx (make-overlay beg end)))
      (overlay-put xx 'face '(:background "#292b2e" :height 150)))
    (shr-ensure-newline)
    (insert "\n")))
#+END_SRC

Sometimes a wrong language is detected, but it is still great for highlight, even just for eye pleasing. If you found the wrong detection is annoying, delete =lang= just like below statement:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(insert (propertize (concat "#+BEGIN_SRC" ) 'face 'org-block-begin-line))
#+END_SRC
